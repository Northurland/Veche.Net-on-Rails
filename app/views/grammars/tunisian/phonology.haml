    %p All vowels with the exception of /ə/ can freely appear at the beginning, middle, or end of a word. /ə/ is only ever found word-internally or finally, never word-initially. Long vowels, though unrestricted, appear most frequently in word-final position.
    %p Valid diphthongs all consist of either /j/ or /w/ as the semivowel. Allowed falling diphthongs are /aj ej oj uj aw ew iw ow/; there are no falling diphthongs with long vowels or with homorganic nucleus and off-glide. The only restriction on rising diphthongs is that they cannot be homorganic: /ja je jo ju jə jaː jeː joː juː wa we wi wo wə waː weː wiː woː/.
    %p Any other two-vowel sequence has two distinct nuclei, with the two vowels belonging to separate syllables.

  = section "Allophony" do
    %p The high vowels /i(ː)/ and /u(ː)/ are generally very stable and do not vary much in pronunciation due to stress or location. However, these two vowels may not appear immediately after an emphatic consonant /tˤ dˤ sˤ zˤ/ or the uvular plosive /q/; historical /i(ː)/ and /u(ː)/ in this position have lowered to /e(ː)/ and /o(ː)/.
    %p The mid vowels /e(ː)/ and /o(ː)/ are more variable in their pronunciation. The short vowels /e/ and /o/ are realized as [e] and [ɔ] in open syllables and as [ɛ] and [o] in closed syllables. The long vowels /eː/ and /oː/ tend to diphthongize when under stress, with a realization similar to [eə] and [ɔə]; the greeting <i>côpac</i> “hello”, for example, is pronounced /ˈkoː.pak/ [ˈkɔə.pʌk].
    %p The low vowel /a(ː)/ has a fairly weak length distinction. Very few speakers contrast /a/ and /aː/ anywhere except word-finally, and even then not all speakers maintain the contrast word-finally. Any /a(ː)/ under stress is generally pronounced as long [aː], while unstressed /a(ː)/ becomes short [ʌ]. Amongst speakers that have lost the word-final contrast as well, the typical merged pronunciation is as long [ɑː] in this position. In higher registers and some more conservative dialects, the contrast between /a/ and /aː/ is still well-preserved in all positions.
    %p The reduced vowel /ə/ is usually realized as a neutral vowel [ə] word-internally. Word-finally, it has a realization further back in the mouth, closer to [ʊ]. However, word-finally it is also frequently elided in informal speech, leaving behind a slight velarization of the preceding consonant or, in the case of final /jə/, as palatalization + [ɪ].
    %p If the elision of final /ə/ results in a consonant cluster, some more complex phonetic changes may take place, according to the general rules of consonant allophony as described in the next section.

  = section "Allophony" do
    = section "Plosives" do
      %p Tunisian has five (non-emphatic) plosive consonants: /p b t d k g q/. Of these, all but /q/ are found in native words of Romance origin; /q/ is found in Arabic and Berber loanwords.
      %p The unvoiced plosives /p t k q/ are generally pronounced very consistently. Word-initially, /p/ and /t/ are usually aspirated, becoming [pʰ] and [tʰ]. /k/ and /q/ may also be aspirated in this position, but this is more regional, and is not a feature of the standard dialect of Tunis. All four are pronounced unaspirated in other positions. In colloquial speech where it is common to drop word-final schwas, these newly-final consonants may be pronounced velarized or even as ejectives: <i>sépte</i> “seven (<abbr title="Feminine">f</abbr>)” [ˈsʲɛptˠ, ˈsʲɛpt'].
      %p The voiced plosives /b d g/ are always unaspirated. They do not vary significantly in pronunciation, though may be velarized before a dropped word-final schwa.
      %p The two dental plosives /t d/ are often palatalized to [tʲ dʲ] immediately before stressed /i(ː)/ or /e(ː)/.
      %p The uvular plosive /q/ cannot be followed by the high vowels /i/ and /u/.

    = section "Fricatives" do
      %p Tunisian has nine (non-emphatic) fricative consonants: /f v θ ð s z ʃ ʒ x/. All except /x/ are found in native Romance words, although /θ/ and /ð/ are quite rare outside of loanwords, and often appear in learned re-borrowed forms such as <i>ćéatr</i> “theater” [ˈθjaː.tɪr].
      %p These fricatives all have fairly stable pronunciations. The dental fricatives /s z/ will usually palatalize to [sʲ zʲ] immediately before a stressed front vowel, and all will be velarized before a dropped schwa. Some speakers, particularly in heavily Arab communities, may also have a voiced velar fricative /γ/ and pharyngeal fricative /ħ/ in Arabic loanwords, both of which are usually borrowed as /x/ in standard Tunisian.

    = section "Emphatics" do
      %p The three emphatic consonants /tˤ dˤ sˤ/ are found exclusively in Arabic and Berber loanwords (with /sˤ/ corresponding to both Arabic ﺽ and ﻅ). They are pronounced velarized, though in practice the sound is often more noticeable on nearby vowels than on the consonant itself. Immediately before a stressed vowel the velarization is usually prominent, while in other locations it is realized more as a [ə] on-glide or off-glide on neighboring vowels. These sounds do not contrast with their non-emphatic counterparts immediately before another consonant, since the effect of velarization on preceding vowels is significantly less than on following vowels. For example, the word <i>tħêl</i> “tall” /tˤeːl/ is usually pronounced as [tˠə̯eəl], with a ə on-glide triggered by the emphatic consonant and the off-glide caused by the usual realization of stressed /eː/. For simplicity's sake, emphatic-induced ə glides will generally not be marked in phonetic transcriptions in this grammar.
      %p Due to colloquial schwa-dropping, word-final /tˤə dˤə sˤə/ and /tə də sə/ are not distinguished in informal speech, with both sets being realized as [tˠ dˠ sˠ]. For instance, the words <i>baide</i> “band, gang” /bajdə/ (from Medieval Latin *banda) and <i>baidħe</i> “egg” /bajdˤə/ (from Arabic ﺐﻴﺿﺓ) colloquially are both pronounced [ˈbajdˠ], despite being distinguished in formal usage.#{footnote}
      %p Emphatic consonants also trigger special allomorphs of certain inflectional endings. For instance, the regular plural suffix is -/s/, but roots ending in emphatic consonants take /-əs/.

    = section "Nasals" do
      %p Tunisian has two nasal consonants, /m/ and /n/. Both are very stable in modern Tunisian (though not historically, as can be seen in many paradigms where /n/ alternates with Ø or a vowel), although /n/ will often assimilate to [ŋ] before velar consonants and [ɴ] before uvular consonants. Before a stressed front vowel, /n/ is palatalized to [nʲ].

    = section "Liquids" do
      %p The two Tunisian liquids are /l/ and /r/.
      %p /l/ typically has a velarized pronunciation in most positions, with a clear [l] sound only before front vowels (and a palatalized [lʲ] sound before stressed front vowels). This velarized pronunciation is especially apparent when /l/ appears before two consonants or word-finally after a consonant, where it is realized as [u]: <i>moscls</i> “muscles” /moskls/ [ˈmos.kuz].
      %p /r/ is pronounced as a tap when intervocalic, and as a trill in all other positions. For historical reasons, it is generally not found in coda position, although an exception can be made for epenthetic vowels as described in section 2.2.2.7.

    = section "Semivowels" do
      %p Tunisian has two semivowels, /j/ and /w/. These may appear intervocally as well as in the various diphthongs discussed earlier.

    = section "Epenthetic Vowels" do
      %p Tunisian morphology often allows for some fairly complex consonant clusters to appear, especially word-finally. These clusters are resolved by following a regular series of steps:
      %ol
        %li If the cluster contains /l/ following a less- or equally-sonorous consonant (i.e., anything other than a semivowel), the /l/ will vocalize and be pronounced [u]: <i>ystls</i> “stars” /istlz/ [ˈis.tuz].
        %li If the cluster contains /m/, /n/, or /r/ following a less- or equally-sonorous consonant, a vowel [ɪ] will be inserted immediately before the nasal/liquid: <i>librs</i> “books” /librz/ [ˈlʲi.bɪrz], <i>ysms</i> “names” /ismz/ [ˈi.sɪmz].
        %li If the cluster contains any other consonant following a less- or equally-sonorous consonant (with the exception of /s/, which may freely follow less sonorous consonants), a vowel [ɪ] will be inserted immediately after the first consonant of the cluster: <i>ystréct</i> “narrow” /istrekt/ [ˈis.trɛ.kɪt], <i>sept</i> “seven” /sept/ [ˈsʲɛ.pɪt].
        %li All other clusters are pronounced as-is, with no epenthetic vowel.
      %p Note that these types of epenthetic vowels <em>do not</em> affect syllable boundaries for the purposes of determining allophony or stress. In <i>sept</i>, for instance, despite the /e/ appearing in an open syllable on a phonetic level, its realization is that of /e/ in a closed syllable. For this reason, such epenthetic vowels are never indicated orthographically.
      %p Only the phoneme /s/ is able to ignore the usual sonority hierarchy, so that words such as <i>pescs</i> “fishes” are realized without any epenthetic vowels: /pesks/ [ˈpɛsks].

= section "Syllables" do
  %p Syllables are divided so as to minimize the coda of the preceding syllable and maximize the onset of the following syllable. Where possible, the syllable break will be placed immediately after a vowel, unless doing so would result in an illegal initial cluster in the following syllable. Every syllable contains exactly one vowel or diphthong on a phonemic level, although as described previously it is not unusual for one syllable on a phonemic level to correspond to multiple nuclei on a phonetic level due to the insertion of automatic epenthetic vowels.
  %p Note that resyllabification can occur across word boundaries if the two words share a single primary stress. This is common, for instance, amongst verbs and verbal clitics, nouns and possessive pronouns, or prepositions and their objects. This provides further evidence for the ephemeral nature of epenthetic vowels: <i>subiect</i> “subject” [su.ˈbjɛ.kɪt], but <i>subiect meo</i> “my subject” [su.ˈbjɛk.tmew].

= section "Stress" do
  %p Tunisian stress is not predictable. The modern system descends by regular rules from the predictable Latin stress system, but due to the loss of the original Latin vowel length distinction, the loss of various unstressed vowels, and the introduction of non-Latin loanwords, it is not possible to predict the stress of a modern Tunisian word given just the word itself. However, the majority of Tunisian words are stressed on the first syllable, due to a historical stress shift that affected most (but not all) inherited words.

= section "Phonotactics" do
  = section "Distribution Restrictions" do
    %p Syllable-initially, any single consonant or vowel may be present, with the exception of the reduced vowel /ə/. Word-initial restrictions are identical to syllable-initial words.
    %p Syllable-finally and word-finally, any vowel may be present without restriction, though non-reduced short vowels are rare word-finally. /r/ is not allowed syllable-finally when immediately preceded by a vowel, though it is permitted if preceded by a consonant (i.e., -Vr is illegal, -VCr is legal). Due to epenthetic vowels, [r] can appear syllable-finally on a phonetic level, however. Word-final /n/ is also very rare except in stressed syllables.

  = section "Clusters" do
    %p Due in large part to Berber influences, Tunisian (as well as Tunisian Arabic) are quite permissive when it comes to consonant clusters. Within a single syllable, there is a clear sonority curve, with the highest sonority in the middle of the syllable (i.e., the syllabic nucleus) and the lowest sonority at the periphery. Thus, the onset permits consonants with increasing sonority, while the coda permits consonants with decreasing sonority. Almost any initial or final cluster is allowed so long as it obeys this sonority law. On a phonemic level, the coda may freely disobey this hierarchy, but epenthetic vowels will be inserted so as to restore it.
    %p However, some differences exist between onset and coda clusters. The onset allows for clusters of two consonants with the same sonority, while the coda does not. Thus, initial *kt- is perfectly allowable, while final *-kt will be realized with an epenthetic vowel: -[kɪt]. On the other hand, the coda allows /s/ to disobey the sonority hierarchy and appear after less sonorous consonants, so that forms such as *-ps or even *-sts are permissible final clusters. As in several other Romance languages, *sC- clusters (where 'C' is a plosive or fricative) are not allowed word-initially (as they disobey the sonority hierarchy), and any such forms in loanwords acquire a stressed /i/: <i>yscanêr</i> “scanner” (from English) [ˈis.kʌ.neː].
    %p The Tunisian sonority hierarchy appears as follows, from highest to lowest: vowels &gt; semivowels &gt; liquids &gt; nasals &gt; fricatives &gt; plosives.
    %p A few other consonants have their own cluster restrictions independent of the sonority hierarchy. The three emphatics are not allowed as the first consonant in a cluster, either in the onset or coda; the language has various morphological means to prevent this from even taking place. This is due to the fact that the emphatic quality is almost entirely indicated by the quality of the following vowel, and so this emphaticness is lost when there is no such vowel.
    %p The phoneme /r/ generally is not allowed in coda position at all, much as in non-rhotic dialects of English. This includes even fairly recent loanwords, where the vowel preceding the dropped /r/ is typically lengthened in compensation. In loanwords the graphical “r” often remains in place: <i>pârc</i> “park” [ˈpaːk]. However, /r/ is allowed word-initially before another consonant, where it acquires an epenthetic vowel much as syllabic /r/ does at the end of syllables: <i>rnoval</i> “spring(time)” /ˈrnoval/ [ɪr.ˈnɔ.vʌl] (cf. syllable-finally in <i>libr</i> “book” /ˈlibr/ [ˈli.bɪr]).
    %p The phoneme /n/ was historically eliminated in coda position throughout inherited vocabulary, but this restriction is no longer in force in stressed syllables: <i>banc</i> “bank” /ˈbank/ [ˈbaːŋk].

  = section "Morpheme Boundaries" do
    %p Morpheme boundaries do not affect words' pronunciation, except insofar as morpheme boundaries coincide with syllable boundaries.

  = section "Word Boundaries and Interword Sandhi" do
    %p In connected speech, word boundaries are ignored within a single stress unit (i.e., a set of words sharing a common primary stress), which allows for sandhi phenomena across word boundaries identical to those intersyllabic rules already discussed. Words may resyllabify in the vicinity of other words, which can in turn impact various transient allophonic phenomena such as epenthetic vowels. Some more complex morphologically-conditioned sandhi may also take place, such as the ablaut in <i>yscle</i> “school” → <i>l-uscle</i> “the school”, triggered by the definite article <i>l-</i>.
    %p Outside of these stress units, interword sandhi is significantly more restricted. The most significant sandhi phenomenon on this level is the tendency for vowels at the end of one word to blend into the first vowel of the following word, should such words end up side-by-side. There may be other sub-phonemic alterations such as voicing assimilation to ease the flow of connected speech.

  = section "Foreign Loans" do
    %p If we consider the class of foreign loans to consist of all words of non-Romance origin, then many such loans stand out quite distinctively in Tunisian due to their distinct phoneme inventories. Any words with certain sounds, such as the emphatic consonants or /x/, can instantly be identified as loaned forms due to the complete lack of these sounds in inherited vocabulary. However, since the Berber influence began to appear even during Roman rule over North Africa and Arabic influence goes back well over a milennium, these sounds are not perceived as foreign, and this oldest layer of loan words has long since been established within the language.
    %p More recent loans, on the other hand, may have a more marked structure. They may contain clusters and sounds not present in Tunisian, which will generally result in adaptation, though in higher registers 'foreign' pronunciations may be heard for a perceived sense of properness or education. Due to the fairly lax syllable restrictions in Tunisian, there is generally little trouble adapting some words to native morphology.

= section "Morphophonemic Alternations" do
  %p Due to the significant morphological levelling that took place between Vulgar Latin and the Romance languages, relatively few transparent morphophonemic alternations survive in modern Tunisian that date to Latin or earlier. Tunisian nouns reflect the Latin accusative singular and plural, which was quite regular in formation, while most alternations within the verbal system have been levelled out. Consequently, the vast majority of morphophonemic alternations in modern Tunisian are the product of developments since the breakup of Vulgar Latin. Among the most common productive alternations are:

%section.footnotes
  = footnote do
    The plurals, however, are clearly distinguished, since roots ending in phonemic emphatic consonants have a distinctive plural formation. Specifically, the plural of <i>baide</i> is <i>baids</i> /bajdz/ “bands”, while the plural of <i>baidħe</i> is <i>baides</i> /bajdəz/ “eggs”.
